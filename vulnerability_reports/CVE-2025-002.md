# Vulnerability Report: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in User Profile

**CVE ID:** CVE-2025-002

## DESCRIPTION:
The application is vulnerable to stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks in the user profile section. Malicious JavaScript code can be injected and stored in user profiles, which will be executed when other users view the profile page. This can lead to session hijacking, data theft, and unauthorized actions.

## TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- The vulnerability is network accessible
- Attack complexity is low and simple to exploit
- Low privileges are required for exploitation (user account)
- User interaction is required (viewing the profile)
- Scope is unchanged and affects the same component
- Low data disclosure occurs
- Low data modification is possible
- No service disruption occurs

## CVSS METRICS:
- **Attack Vector:** Network
- **Attack Complexity:** Low
- **Privileges Required:** Low
- **User Interaction:** Required
- **Scope:** Unchanged
- **Confidentiality Impact:** Low
- **Integrity Impact:** Low
- **Availability Impact:** None

## EXPECTED RESULT:
- **Base Score:** 5.4 (Medium)
- **Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N

## REMEDIATION:
- Implement proper input validation and output encoding
- Use Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- Sanitize all user-generated content before storage
- Implement XSS protection mechanisms
- Regular security testing and code reviews
