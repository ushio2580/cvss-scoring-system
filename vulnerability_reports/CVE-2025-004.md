# Vulnerability Report: Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)

**CVE ID:** CVE-2025-004

## DESCRIPTION:
The application suffers from an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability in the document management system. Attackers can access and download documents belonging to other users by manipulating the document ID parameter in the URL. This vulnerability allows unauthorized access to sensitive documents and confidential information.

## TECHNICAL DETAILS:
- The vulnerability is network accessible
- Attack complexity is low and simple to exploit
- Low privileges are required for exploitation (authenticated user)
- No user interaction is needed
- Scope is unchanged and affects the same component
- High data disclosure occurs
- No data modification occurs
- No service disruption occurs

## CVSS METRICS:
- **Attack Vector:** Network
- **Attack Complexity:** Low
- **Privileges Required:** Low
- **User Interaction:** None
- **Scope:** Unchanged
- **Confidentiality Impact:** High
- **Integrity Impact:** None
- **Availability Impact:** None

## EXPECTED RESULT:
- **Base Score:** 6.5 (Medium)
- **Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

## REMEDIATION:
- Implement proper authorization checks for all object references
- Use indirect object references or UUIDs instead of sequential IDs
- Implement access control lists (ACLs)
- Regular security testing and code reviews
- Apply the principle of least privilege
- Implement proper session management
